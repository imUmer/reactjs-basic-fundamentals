This is my notes

Of course there are some you 
might use more often like useState and useEffect,
 but understanding the other ones like useMemo,
 useCallback or useRef is also essential.

what is "state"?
ups and downs of class and functional components
what are component re-renderings and how do they work?
how to trigger re-renderings
different component lifecycles and how to interact with them
Virtual DOM
Benefits of CSR (Client Side Rendering) and SSR (Server Side Rendering) in general and in React
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components
State Lifting
at least one global state management technology (Context API, Redux/Toolkit, Recoil)
Component Patterns (especially how to choose the right pattern)

const SeasonScores = ({ seasonScoresData }) => {
	
    return (
    	<>
        	<h3>Our scores in this season:<h3>
        	{seasonScoresData.map((score, index) => (
    			<div key={index}>
        			<p>{score.oponennt}</p>
        			<p>{score.value}</p>
        		</div>
    		))}
        </>
    )
}
